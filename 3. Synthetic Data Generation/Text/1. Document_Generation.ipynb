    "# Synthetic Document generation with YData SDK\n",
    "Synthetic documents are AI-generated files that mimic real-world reports, resumes, contracts, and other types of documents. They are valuable for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training LLMs** without using sensitive or proprietary data\n",
    "- **Testing pipelines** or document-processing systems with realistic content\n",
    "- **Augmenting datasets** when original documents are scarce or unavailable\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we demonstrate how to generate synthetic documents using the `DocumentGenerator` class from the YData SDK.\n",
    "You will learn how to:\n",
    "1. Generate a single or a set of synthetic documents with your own requirements\n",
    "2. Adjust document formats and styles\n",

    "```\n",
    " pip install ydata-sdk\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Synthetic document generation is a valuable strategy for companies looking to improve the performance and generalization of their AI models—especially those working with language models or document processing systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating high-quality, domain-specific synthetic documents, organizations can:\n",
    "- **Augment fine-tuning datasets** with diverse, multilingual examples\n",
    "- **Pre-train or adapt LLMs** to specific document structures or business jargon\n",
    "- **Expand coverage** across rare use cases or underrepresented formats\n",
    "- **Avoid legal risks** tied to using real documents containing PII or proprietary content\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it particularly useful for teams in:\n",
    "- **Healthcare** (e.g., discharge summaries, lab reports)\n",
    "- **Finance** (e.g., credit statements, policy summaries)\n",
    "- **Legal** (e.g., contracts, NDAs)\n",
    "- **Human Resources** (e.g., resumes, evaluations)\n",
    "\n",
    "With just a few lines of code, you can generate realistic, custom-tailored PDFs, DOCX, or HTML files that accelerate model development without compromising on privacy or compliance.\n",
