    "# Data quality - label inconsistencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Label inconsistencies can significantly undermine the development of machine learning models, particularly in sensitive use cases like fraud detection. When labels are inconsistent—such as when similar transactions are labeled differently—it creates noise in the training data, which leads to unreliable models. This directly impacts the model’s ability to accurately predict fraudulent behavior, increasing the likelihood of both false positives and false negatives. In critical industries, such as finance, these errors can have substantial economic and operational consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthetic data generation is also impacted by label inconsistencies. If the original dataset contains labeling errors or inconsistencies, the synthetic data generated from it will replicate these issues, propagating flawed patterns and reducing the effectiveness of both synthetic data and models trained on them. Thus, ensuring label consistency is vital for maintaining the quality of your data! "
