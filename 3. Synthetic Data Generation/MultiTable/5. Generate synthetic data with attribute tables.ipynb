    "# MultiTable synthesis - Database with attribute tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases often include attribute tables that provide descriptive metadata about entities in a primary table. These attribute tables, such as those describing product categories, geographic locations, or league information, enhance the database structure by offering additional context and classification for the main data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When generating synthetic data for schemas with attribute tables, it is essential to:\n",
    "- Ensure that all references in the main table align with valid entries in the attribute tables.\n",
    "- Maintain the logical connections between entities and their attributes.\n",
    "- Preserve the distribution and relationships between attribute values and the main data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces strategies for generating synthetic datasets that respect the relationships between primary and attribute tables. By maintaining relational integrity and ensuring realistic attribute distributions, the resulting data can be effectively used for testing, analytics, or machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will explore this can be achive by leveraging the [Football database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/technika148/football-database)."
