    "# Multi-Table Synthesis combined with Anonymization\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining synthetic data with traditional anonymization enhances privacy and data utility while ensuring compliance with regulations. Synthetic data reduces re-identification risks by not being directly tied to individuals, preserving the usefulness of data for analysis. This approach also facilitates safer data sharing and collaboration by adding an extra layer of privacy protection that allows to replicate the same schema while protecting certain identifiers, like zip-codes or even unique identifiers, making it a strategic choice for organizations handling sensitive information.\n",
