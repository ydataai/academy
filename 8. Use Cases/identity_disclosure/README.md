# Identity disclosure risk in a fully synthetic dataset
The goal of this use case is to showcase a reliable and feasible use of synthetic data for data-sharing initiatives. Understanding the variable's different privacy requirements (identifiers and quasi-identifiers) and how to assess synthetic data risk of disclosure is critical to validate the generated data privacy standards.Â 

The dataset used to explore this use case can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset).
