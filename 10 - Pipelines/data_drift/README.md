# Data Drift Monitoring and Business Rules Validation with YData Fabric Pipelines

This repository demonstrates a **Data Drift Monitoring and Business Rules Validation** use case using **YData Fabric Pipelines**. By leveraging profiling tools, metadata drift reports, and business rules validation with ConstraintEngine, this solution tracks data quality changes over time and ensures data adherence to defined rules, supporting consistent, high-quality data in production.

## Key Components

- **YData Fabric Pipelines**: Automates data drift and rules validation checks as part of a recurring data workflow, ensuring continuous data quality monitoring.
- **Profiling Compare**: Conducts side-by-side analysis of historical and current datasets, identifying changes in distribution for early drift detection.
- **Metadata Drift Reports**: Generates summaries of detected drifts in key data attributes, pinpointing which features have changed and supporting proactive data quality management.
- **ConstraintEngine for Business Rules Validation**: Applies user-defined business rules and constraints (e.g., value ranges, data types) to ensure data meets required standards, flagging records that do not comply.

## Usage

1. **Set up the Pipeline**: Configure a YData Fabric pipeline to run scheduled checks for data drift and business rules validation, specifying data sources, drift criteria, and business rules.
2. **Run Profiling Compare**: Analyze and visualize differences between datasets to detect distribution shifts, validating changes over time.
3. **Generate Metadata Drift Reports**: Automatically create reports detailing drift in key variables for actionable insights.
4. **Apply ConstraintEngine Rules**: Define and enforce constraints that align with business requirements, validating that incoming data consistently meets quality standards.

## Benefits

- **Automated Monitoring**: Ensures continuous data quality checks, reducing manual intervention and catching issues early.
- **Data Integrity Assurance**: Business rules and constraints provide a structured approach to maintain compliance and consistency.
- **Visual and Reported Insights**: Profiling compare and metadata reports make it easy to interpret data shifts and rule violations, supporting quick action.
- **Improved Model Performance**: Continuous validation helps maintain data consistency, enhancing machine learning model accuracy and reliability.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository inside [YData Fabric Labs](https://docs.fabric.ydata.ai/latest/labs/).
2. Configure your pipeline with the data sources ID, business rules, and drift criteria and thresholds.
3. Run the pipeline to enable automated drift and rules monitoring for your datasets.
