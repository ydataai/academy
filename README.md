# 🧠 YData Academy: ydata-sdk Tutorials & Use Cases

Welcome to **YData Academy**, a collection of hands-on tutorials and use-cases built entirely with the [ydata-sdk](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-sdk).

Whether you're just getting started with synthetic data or diving into advanced data anonymization and generative AI, this repository will guide you through each core capability of `ydata-sdk`.

## 📦 About ydata-sdk

[`ydata-sdk`](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-sdk) is a Python package designed to simplify data-centric AI development. It includes tools for:
- Data exploration and profiling
- Synthetic data generation and evaluation
- Data anonymization and privacy preservation
- Integrations with generative AI for document analysis and Q&A (questions and answers pairs)
